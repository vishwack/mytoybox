# Bot Builder SDK

See [Azure Bot Service Introduction](https://aka.ms/BotBuilderOverview) for an overview of how to build a bot.

Azure Bot Service provides tools to build, test, deploy, and manage connect intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services. The modular and extensible BotBuilder SDK provides templates to create bots that provide speech, language understanding, question and answer, and more.â€¯  

The Microsoft Bot Builder SDK is a powerful, easy-to-use framework that provides a familiar way for .NET and Node.js developers to develop bots. The Bot Builder SDK provides features that make interactions between bots and users much simpler. Bot Builder also includes an emulator for debugging your bots, as well as a large set of sample bots you can use as building blocks.

- More samples are available within the SDK [C#](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/tree/master/CSharp/Samples), [Node.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/tree/master/Node/examples)
- Create a bot using [SDK](http://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-quickstart), [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart), or use [CLI tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-build-botbuilder-templates)
- [Bot framework emulator](http://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emaultor)
- [Bot Builder tools](http://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools)
- Add components: 
  - Add language understanding model [LUIS](http://luis.ai)
  - Add [QnA Maker](http://qnamaker.ai) knowledge base to answer questions users ask
  - If you are using more than model, for example QnA with LUIS or multiple LUIS models, your bot will need to know which one to use when. See how to use the [dispatch tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/Dispatch) to manage multiple models
