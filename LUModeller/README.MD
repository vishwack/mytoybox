# LUModeller
Imagine a world where you can quickly author language understanding components for your bot using a simple markdown file... The .lu file and the LUModeller tool was born to serve few use cases:
- Describe intents, entities, utterances and patterns for your bot in simple markdown documents
- The langauge understanding definition for your bot lives with the rest of your code. You can use other CLI tools like luis to create a new LUIS app using the .lu files
- Group language understanding documents by langauge x locale for easier to manage localization purposes.
- Define question and answer pairs for your bot.

The LUModeller tool converts .lu files to a LUIS model json file.

## Installation
```bash
npm i -g lumodeller
```

## Output
LUModeller tool will output:
- LUIS json file if any LUIS concept definitions are found in the .lu file(s)
- QnA json file if any QnAMaker.ai concept definitions are found in the .lu file(s)

## .lu File Format
.lu files contain markdown-like, simple text based definitions for [LUIS](http://luis.ai) or [QnAmaker.ai](http://qnamaker.ai) concepts. 

### Intent
An intent represents actions the user wants to perform. The intent is a purpose or goal expressed in a user's input, such as booking a flight, paying a bill, or finding a news article. You define and name intents that correspond to these actions. A travel app may define an intent named "BookFlight."

Here's a simple .lu file that captures a simple 'Greeting' intent with example utterances that capture ways users can express this intent:

```
# Greeting
Hi
Hello
Good morning
Good evening
```

'#\<intent-name\>' describes a new intent definition section. Each line after the intent definition are example utterances that describe that intent.

You can stitch together multiple intent definitions in a single file like this:

```
# Greeting
Hi
Hello
Good morning
Good evening

# Help
help
I need help
please help
```
Each section is idenfied by #\<intent name\> notation. Blank lines are skipped when parsing the file.

### Entity
An entity represents detailed information that is relevant in the utterance. For example, in the utterance "Book a ticket to Paris", "Paris" is a location. 

|Sample user utterance|entity|
|--------------------------|----------|
|"Book a flight to **Seattle**?"|Seattle|
|"When does your store **open**?"|open|
|"Schedule a meeting at **1pm** with **Bob** in Distribution"|1pm, Bob|

Entity in .lu file is denoted using {\<entityName\>:\<labelled value\>} notation. Here's an example: 

```
# CreateAlarm
create an alarm for {alarmTime:7AM}
set an alarm for {alarmTime:7AM}
```

LUModeller tool supports the following [LUIS entity types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/LUIS/luis-concept-entity-types)
- Prebuilt ("datetimeV2", "age", "dimension", "email", "money", "number", "ordinal", "percentage", "phoneNumber","temperature", "url")
- List
- Simple

LUModeller tool <b>*does not*</b> support the following LUIS entity types:
- Regular expression
- Hierarchical
- Composite

You can define an entity type by using the $\<entityName\>:\<entityType\> notation. Here's an example: 

```
# CreateAlarm
create an alarm for {alarmTime:7AM}
set an alarm for {alarmTime:7AM}

$alarmTime:Simple
```

You can describe list entites using the following notation:
$listEntity:list
\<itemName\>
    \<synonym1\>
    \<synonym2\>

Here's an example definition of a list entity: 

```
$commPreference:list
call:
	phone call
	give me a ring
	ring
	call
	cell phone
	phone
text:
	message
	text
	sms
	text message
```

You can also enhance LUIS understanding of your model using [PhraseLists](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/LUIS/luis-tutorial-interchangeable-phrase-list)

Here's an example of a phrase list definition:

```
$ChocolateType:phraseList
m&m,mars,mints,spearmings,payday,jelly,kit kat,kitkat,twix
```
Note that the parser defaults to simple entity type.

### Patterns
Patterns are a new feature in LUIS that allows you to define a set of rules that augment the machine learned model. You can define patterns in the .lu file by prefixing the utterance with '~'. Here's an example: 

```
# DeleteAlarm
~delete alarm
~(delete|remove) the {alarmTime} alarm
```
One of the benefits of patterns is that you do not have to provide a labelled value to an entity.

Note: By default any entity that is left undescribed in a pattern will be mapped to Pattern.Any entity type.

### Roles
Entities can have roles. You can define roles for entities using the $\<entityRole\>:\<entityType\> notation. Here's an example where both addTime and remTime are roles of the datetimeV2 entity: 

```
# CreateAlarm
~create an alarm
~create an alarm for {addTime}
~set an alarm for {addTime}

$addTime:datetimeV2

# DeleteAlarm
~delete alarm
~(delete|remove) the {remTime} alarm

$remTime:datetimeV2
```

### Question and Answer pairs
.lu file (and the parser) supports question and answer definitions as well. You can this notation to describe them
?\<question\>
\<answer\>

Here's an example of question and answer definitions. The LUModeller tool will automatically separate question and answers into a qnamaker JSON file that you can then use to create your new [QnaMaker.ai](http://qnamaker.ai) knowledge base article.

```
? How can I change the default message from QnA Maker?
You can change the default message if you use the QnAMakerDialog. See this for details: https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/azure-bot-service/templates/qnamaker/#navtitle

? How do I programmatically update my KB?
You can use our REST apis to manage your KB. See here for details: https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/58994a073d9e04097c7ba6fe/operations/58994a073d9e041ad42d9baa
```

You can add multiple questions to the same answer by simply additing variations to questions. Here's an example

```
? Who is your name?
? What should I call you?
I'm the echoBot! Nice to meet you.
```

### External references
Two different references are supported in the .lu file:
- Reference to another .lu file via #ref('\<.lu file name\>')
- Reference to URL for QnAMaker to ingest during KB creation via #url('\<URL\>')

Here's an example of those references: 

```
? How can I change the default message from QnA Maker?
You can change the default message if you use the QnAMakerDialog. See this for details: https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/azure-bot-service/templates/qnamaker/#navtitle

#url('https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/faqs')

#ref('./none.lu')
```

### Adding comments
You can add comments to your .lu document by prefixing the comment with //. Here's an example: 

```
// This is a comment and will be ignored

#Greeting
hi
hello
```

You can also add comments in a line. All text after // will be ignored and treated as a comment.
